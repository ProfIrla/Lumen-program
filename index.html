Honors electives, honors enriched experiences, and study abroad as an honors elective module option will still be offered.

		answer: "In general, honors courses go broader and deeper than non-honors courses. A document and recording of a faculty development presentation called Philosophy and Pedagogy of the Lumen Scholars Program is available to view in the Honors Program Portal site. Lumen courses are meant to emphasize interdisciplinarity and/or gaps in between traditional majors and minors at McDaniel. Instructors will be working with students from a variety of disciplines. Courses in the Lumen Honors Program share common approaches and practices including The Place as Text framework; Experiential and active learning; At least one common read. This could be a full text (book), article, case study, etc; In-class discussions with an emphasis on student-led conversations and inquiry; A common deliverable or project wherein students work/create together, with encouragement for students to take the lead; Talking to strangers, through interactions either on or off campus, in-person or virtual; An emphasis on observation and reflection; Incorporate civic engagement, a broad umbrella term that can include research and data-driven solutions; Awareness, advocacy, and activism; Creative and cultural contributions to a community; Entrepreneurship and innovation; Professional and workplace initiatives such as promoting sustainability; Digital activism.",

	  { 
        question: "How are first-year students admitted to the Lumen Scholars Program?", 
        answer: "Prospective first-year students are invited to apply for the program by our Admissions team. This invitation depends on the academic rigor of their high school and their overall GPA. Upon invitation, students complete an application, a sample of which can be found in the Honors Program Office Site on the Portal.

The committee considers academic integrity, the creativity of the response, and the quality and organization of the response.",

      { 
        question: "Is there Honors housing for Lumen Scholars?", 
        answer: "There is currently an honors room selection process. For first year Lumen Scholars: 43 beds in Daniel McLea Hall are available first for early decision students. If the early decision students do not fill all 43 spots, priority then goes to incoming Lumen Scholars. After the first year, Lumen Scholars will need a 3.2 GPA to participate in Honors room selection. Lumens have access to eight suites in Daniel McLea Hall and two floors in Forlines House. Housing in these areas is not guaranteed for all Lumen Scholars, but Lumens get to participate in the process.",

      },
      { 
        question: "A 3.5 GPA is a requirement of the Lumen Scholars Program. What if a Lumen Scholar’s GPA falls below the 3.5 minimum?", 
        answer: "First and second-year students whose cumulative GPAs falls below 3.2 may remain in the program but will not be given priority registration or be able to participate in the honors room selection process. By the end of the sophomore year, if a student’s GPA is 3.0 or lower, they will be removed from the program; if a student’s GPA falls between 3.01 and 3.2, they will need to meet with the Assistant Director to discuss a GPA recovery plan and it is at the Assistant Director’s discretion whether they can remain in the program. To graduate with the distinction of College Scholar/Lumen Scholar, an honors student’s cumulative GPA must meet or exceed 3.5. In March of the student’s senior year, the Registrar’s Office confirms those students who will graduate from the Program. If the student’s cumulative GPA is below 3.5 at that time, they will not graduate with the distinction of College/Lumen Scholar.",

      },
      { 
        question: "Is an honors student / Lumen Scholar required to complete departmental honors in their major program(s)?",
        answer: "No, there is not a requirement for current honors students / Lumen Scholars to participate in their major’s departmental honors program. Departmental honors requirements vary widely across departments, and while honors students / Lumen Scholars will likely be eligible to participate in or receive the departmental honors distinction, it is not a general requirement for all students in the Lumen Scholars Program.",
        tags: ["Students", "Faculty", "Staff"]
      },

        question: "How may a student leave the Honors / Lumen Scholars program?",

      },
	  { 
        question: "I’m interested in participating in the Lumen Budapest opportunity. How do I sign up?",
